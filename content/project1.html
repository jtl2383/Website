<p><em>For the year of 2017, I have compiled 3 different datasets, comparing each of the states in the US. The first, entitled GradRates17, encompasses the graduation rate, Poverty17 holds the number of poverty cases and the total population of each state, and Budget17 contains the total budget, budget towards mental health care, and budget towards education. While the information was published online, I input the data into a csv file manually. State budgets were acquired from Ballotpedia.org as well as populations. Graduation rates were acquired from Eduweek.org, and poverty rates were acquired from www.census.gov.</em></p>
<p><em>These datasets were particularly interesting to me as this begins to delve into what I will be researching in my master’s program for Public Health. I’m very interested in how mental health care, provided through the means of public education systems, affects children and their futures, hence the graduation and poverty rates in my set. While this project is only a small snippet into potential associations between the prioritization of a state’s health care and education, it could provide insight into which states could potentially be used as models for states with higher poverty and lower graduation rates. As of now, I would expect to see a positive correlation between education and mental health spending and graduation rates, and a a negative association with poverty rates.</em></p>
<p><em>The code below is transforming each separate dataset into data frames that will seamlessly combine. In GradRates17, pivot_wider() widened the variables ‘State’ and ‘Graduation.Rates.Percent’ into a dataframe where each state is a separate variable with a value of the graduation rate. pivot_longer() recreates the table containing the two variables &quot;State’ and ‘Graduation’,containing the graduation rate. as.factor() transforms the State variable from a character variable into a factor variable for GradRates17, Budget17, and Poverty17. mutate() creates a new variable with identical data from ‘Total.Spending’, but labeled as ‘Total Budget’. An additional pivot_longer() takes all the variables, aside from ‘State’ and ‘Total Budget’, and creates a new categorical variable, ‘Budget.Type’, clarifying the type of budget, either Education, Mental Health Care, or Total, and a new numerical variable of how much money was spent on each budget.</em></p>

<p><em>Here the 3 datasets were all joined by matching on the variable &quot;State. Since there were no NAs in any of the datasets, and each contained all 50 states, full_join() was used to ensure combination and retention of all values and variables. In the ‘FullData’ dataset, the new variables were ‘State’(factor), ‘Graduation’(double class due to the decimal), ‘Poverty.Cases’(integer), ‘Total.Population’(integer), ‘Total Budget’(double class), ‘Budget.Type’(character), and ‘Amount Spent’ per budget(double class). The first few lines rows of data can be viewed by glimpse().</em></p>

<p><em>Two new datasets were create: EduData and MentalData. EduData was created by selecting only the rows from FullData that contained ‘Education.Spending’ as the Budget Type. Then a new variable, ‘Education Percentage of Total Budget(%)’ was created by dividing the amount spent on the education budget by the total budget and multiplying the result by 100. A new variable, ‘Poverty Rate(%)’ was created by dividing the column of poverty cases by total populations for each state and multiplying by 100. Then only the rows of State, graduation rates, poverty rates, and education percentage of total budgets were kept. The same process was repeated for MentalData, but only rows from FullData that contained ‘Mental.Health.Spending’ as the budget type,and the variable ‘Mental Health Percentage of Total Budget(%)’ was created and kept. FullData1 was the full join of EduData and MentalData, which combined on the variables ‘State’, ‘Graduation’ and ‘Poverty Rate(%)’ and ‘Graduation’ was renamed as ‘Graduation Rate(%)’. Then the variables were reordered in the data frame to have State first, followed by Poverty Rate, Graduation rate, education percentage of total budget, and mental health percentage of total budget.</em></p>

<p><em>To create a new categorical variable describing the priority a state placed mental health care and education budgetwise, a blank variable, ‘Spending Priority’ was first created and filled with NAs. Then this was filled depending on which logical condition the state fulfilled. A state could either be high or low priority on education depending on if they spent higher or lower than 15% of their budget on education, and high or low on mental health priority depending on if they spent higher or lower than 2% of their budget on mental health care. While I set the threshholds myself, for a more in depth project, I would use more research to determine the cutoffs.</em></p>

The titles of the horizontal axis were then titled to be at a 45 degree angle so as it make it easier to read without any overlap of the titles.The highest correlation that existed was a negative correlation between poverty rates and graduation rates, followed by an equal negative correlation between education percentage of budget and poverty rate, and mental health percentage of budget and poverty rate.The shocking negative correlation was the negative correlation between mental health percentage and graduation rates.</em></p>

<p><em>PAM clustering was utilized first creating a pam_dat dataset composed of all 4 numeric variables atfer scaling their values. To determine how many clusters we should use, average silhoutte width needs to be calculated. First an empty vector was created to hold the average silhouette widths.

A line plot was created out of the average silhoutte widths and 2 clusters yielded the highest average, making it the best number of clusters to use.

Then a new dataset, confmat was created by grouping the States by their Spending Priority and counting up how many from each spending priority made it into each cluster. The data was then rearranged to make the rows the spending priorites and the columns the clusters with the counts as values. Then to determine the accuracy of the clustering, confmat was coerced into a matrix and then determining the hit rate. The hit rate is determined by counting how many of each spending priority group made it into the separate diagonal portion of the matrix. If all the states were clustered perfectly, then all of one spending priority would be in cluster 1, all of another spending priority would be in cluster 2 and so on.
