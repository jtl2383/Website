      <description>Python and R languages can communicate with each other within RStudio. By using the package “reticulate”, Rstudio is now able to understand and call from code written in a python chunk in subsequent python AND R chunks.
library(reticulate);library(stringr) In python, I have created the following sentence as a string. It is saved as a string in the local environment.
sentence = &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a Texas Ex baby!!!!&amp;quot; sentence ## &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a Texas Ex baby!</description>
